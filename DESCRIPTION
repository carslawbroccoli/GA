Description: A genetic algorithm for variable selection in regression problems, 
    including both linear regression and GLM.  Used for handling binary functions
    to fit data and produce the best model based on input data.  This package was 
    assembled as part of the final project of STAT243 at the University of California,
    Berkeley, Fall 2017.
